ABSTRACT = {Deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stackedautoencoders, have recently been successfully used to extract deep features for hyperspectral dataclassification. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are another type of neural networks, which arewidely used for sequence analysis because they are constructed to extract contextual information fromsequences by modeling the dependencies between different time steps. In this paper, we study theability of RNN for hyperspectral data classification by extracting the contextual information from thedata. Specifically, hyperspectral data are treated as spectral sequences, and an RNN is used to modelthe dependencies between different spectral bands. In addition, we propose to use a convolutionalrecurrent neural network (CRNN) to learn more discriminative features for hyperspectral dataclassification. In CRNN, a few convolutional layers are first learned to extract middle-level andlocally-invariant features from the input data, and the following recurrent layers are then employedto further extract spectrally-contextual information from the features generated by the convolutionallayers. Experimental results on real hyperspectral datasets show that our method provides betterclassification performance compared to traditional methods and other state-of-the-art deep learningmethods for hyperspectral data classification.},
